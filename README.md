Self-Driving Car in Java (No External Libraries)

Overview

This project is a basic self-driving car simulation written in Java without using any external libraries. The program simulates a car that navigates a predefined path while avoiding obstacles based on simple logic.

Features

Simulated self-driving car movement

Basic obstacle detection

Simple decision-making for navigation

How It Works

The program initializes a car object with basic attributes like position, speed, and direction.

The car follows a predefined path and checks for obstacles.

If an obstacle is detected, the car changes direction to avoid collision.

The simulation continues running until a stopping condition is met.
